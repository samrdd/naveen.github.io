### [**The Promise And Peril Of Big Data**](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/docs/pubs/The_Promise_and_Peril_of_Big_Data.pdf).
**Author: David Bollier, Rapporteur**

This book provides a brief overview of how we can effectively use Big Data while also discussing the various problems associated with Big Data and how to maintain user privacy. Despite the fact that there isn't much technical information in this book, I liked it because it provided a lot of information about how Big Data affects people and how it can be disruptive. The author also discussed how Big Data is causing harm to society, as well as various approaches to addressing those issues. Aside from these, I enjoyed the quotes in this book, such as "One man's noise is another man's data", "The more people you have playing with the data, the more people are going to do useful things with it" etc. The author's use of these quotes from famous people for each topic he discussed piqued my interest even more. Overall, this is a good book to learn a brief overview of Big Data and some of the issues surrounding user privacy.
