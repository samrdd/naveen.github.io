## DATA SET INTERESTED - WORLD BANK DATA

I am interested in [**WORLD BANK DATA**](https://data.worldbank.org/). due to the following reasons
- The World Bank data contains records of all countries' data, including financial, health, population, and climate information. We can estimate several factors influencing the world's economy and health using this data.
- For example by using the health and nutrition data, we can estimate the which country is facing more issues iin providing nutrition food to the people at a reasonable prices and based on the results world bank can give loan at a low interest rate or give any subsidiaries.
- We can also estimate the global and individual country population growth rates and take appropriate measures.
- By using the financial data we can estimate the future GDP's or growth rate of each and every country and sanction loans based on the future capital of countries.
- By using the climate data we can monitor the climate changes of the countries also their CO2 emissions.
- We can also use this data to track the mortality rate, literacy rate, poverty rate, and a variety of other factors.
